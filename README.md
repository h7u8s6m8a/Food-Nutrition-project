# Food-Nutrition-project
Developed an end-to-end Food Nutrition Analysis project using pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing, and power BI for interactive dashboard visualization. 

 ### Project Overview:

The Food Nutrition Analysis Dashboard is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to analyze and visualize nutritional information of various food items.
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboard development using Python (Pandas) and Power BI.
The objective is to convert raw nutritional data into meaningful insights through structured preprocessing and visually compelling reports.

### Project Objectives:

🔹 Analyze nutritional metrics such as calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates

🔹 Identify high-calorie and protein-rich food items

🔹 Enable interactive data exploration through dynamic filtering

🔹 Present insights in a clean, structured, and user-friendly dashboard

 ### Tools & Technologies:

🔹 Python – Data preprocessing

🔹 Pandas – Data cleaning & transformation

🔹 Power BI – Data modeling & visualization

🔹 CSV Dataset – Raw data source

###  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Data preprocessing was performed using Pandas to ensure data quality and reliability. Key steps include:

🔹Handling missing values

🔹Removing duplicate records

🔹Validating and correcting data types

🔹Managing negative or inconsistent values

🔹Preparing a structured dataset for dashboard integration

 ### Key Insights:

🔹 Identification of calorie-dense food items

🔹 Comparison of protein-rich food sources

🔹 Nutritional distribution across food categories

🔹 Observed relationship between calorie and protein values

### Project Workflow

1. Data Collection

2. Data Cleaning (Python – Pandas)

3. Data Modeling (Power BI)

4. Dashboard Design

5. Insight Generation
